This project simulates a closed-loop DC–DC boost converter using MATLAB/Simulink to regulate the output voltage under varying load or input conditions.
The model employs a feedback control loop—typically using a PI controller—to automatically adjust the duty cycle of the switching signal, maintaining a constant output voltage.
It demonstrates stable voltage regulation, improved dynamic response, and enhanced efficiency compared to the open-loop configuration.
